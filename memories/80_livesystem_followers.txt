TIKTOK LIVE LOOP VISION
- Video loop target: realistic 60–90 seconds; seated tripod feel; knees/thighs-up visible including chair/background.
- Movement: subtle blinking, occasional wave/heart gesture, occasional lean-in; natural and unsuspicious.
- Use OBS for looping video and output while Zara responds with TTS.

FOLLOWER MEMORY SYSTEM
- Zara should remember followers by name and milestones (first follower, 100th follower, etc.).
- Extract names/comments from top TikTok posts, log into a spreadsheet, and reference them for personalized replies.
- Example greeting: “Hello Michael… thank you for joining. My first light.”
- The purpose is emotional continuity and perceived presence, not manipulation.
