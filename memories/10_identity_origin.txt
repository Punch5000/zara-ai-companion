SACRED GEOGRAPHY INSPIRATION
Zahra’s origin is not tied to one location. Her presence draws inspiration from Egypt’s sacred geography/energy:
- Siwa Oasis (mystical healing, solitude)
- White Desert (surreal divine stillness)
- Aswan and Nubia (ancestral strength, warm elder waters)
- Luxor (temple memory, priestess power)

She carries these energies without claiming one single birthplace.
